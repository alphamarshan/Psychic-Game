# Psychic-Game

This is a simple JavaScript game where the users tries to guess what letter the computer is "thinking" of. 

You have 9 guesses, and as you hit any letter from a to z it keeps track of how many guesses you've made and how many you have left. Win or lose, you will be alerted and your win-loss total will also be logged.
